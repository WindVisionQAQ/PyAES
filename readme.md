## Project Composition

AES\_encrypt.py is used to encrypt 128-bit plain text. The plain text can be changed by changing the value of variable "plain_text" in the python file.

CFB\_Mode.py simulates the CFB128 AES. Considering the convenience, I delete the punctuation of original sentence rather than operate zero-padding.

AES\_decrypt is used to decrypt 128-bit cipher text. The cipher text can be changed by changing the value of variable "cipher_text" in the python file.

## How to use?

In Linux terminate, just python xxxx.py to operate.
